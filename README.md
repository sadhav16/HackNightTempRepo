# Temporary Repository for GitHub Experience Display

This temporary repository serves as a dynamic showcase of a user's GitHub experiences and previous works. It provides a streamlined interface to input a GitHub username and preferred programming stacks. The repository fetches and displays:

**User Repositories:** It retrieves and lists all repositories owned by the specified GitHub user, showcasing their project contributions.

**Programming Stacks:** Users can input multiple programming languages or technologies (stacks), which are then used to filter and display repositories containing these stacks.

**Repository Insights:** For each relevant repository, the interface highlights the percentage of the stack used and provides statistics such as the number of commits.
This setup allows users to quickly review and analyze their GitHub activity, giving an overview of their technical skills and project history in a visually organized manner.
